ABS Creation Workflow:
The issuer creates an SPV and ABS contract on the Corda network.
The issuer adds the underlying assets to the SPV contract.
The ABS contract contains the details of the underlying assets, the cash flows they generate, and the rules for the distribution of the cash flows to the tranches.
Tranching Workflow:
The issuer creates separate tranches by dividing the cash flows into different levels of risk.
The tranches are represented as separate contracts on the Corda network and contain the details of the cash flows, the interest rate, and the repayment priority.
The tranches are typically divided into senior, mezzanine, and subordinated tranches.
ABS Issuance Workflow:
The issuer lists the tranches on the Corda network.
Investors can view the tranches and place bids for the tranches they are interested in buying.
The issuer accepts the bids that match their requirements.
Once the bids are accepted, the investors transfer the funds to the issuer in exchange for the tranches.
The issuer transfers the tranches to the investors and sets up the cash flow distribution according to the rules outlined in the ABS contract.
